Searching SHODAN.IO with a python script

Browed heavely from https://github.com/BullsEye0/shodan-eye as this was very nicely done but I edited it to take a few items out and make it useful for me.

A user can select how many records to make and can extract the info into a format that is easy to read

## A collection of search queries for Shodan is attached:
Shodan Dorks ... The Internet of Sh*t
* https://github.com/BullsEye0/shodan-eye/blob/master/Shodan_Dorks_The_Internet_of_Sh*t.txt
****

This script is written in Python 3

pip install -r requirements.txt

python shorch.py
then add in your shodan.io api key. 

Thankyou BullsEye0
